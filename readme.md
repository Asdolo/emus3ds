## Emus for 3DS

Emus for 3DS currently contains a single core VirtuaNES for 3DS, a high compatibility NES emulator for your old 3DS or 2DS. It runs at full 60 FPS for almost all games, and supports tonnes of mappers: MMC1,3,5,6; VRC1,2,3,4,6,7; and tonnes of others.

It fixes a few bugs from VirtuaNES's MMC5 mappers and even plays Rockman 4 Minus Infinity and Zelda Legend of Link hacks.

It also runs on your New 3DS as well!

##.CHX Cheat File format

The .CHX is a cheat file format that you can create with any text editor. Each line in the file corresponds to one cheat, and is of the following format:

     [Y/N],[CheatCode],[Name]

1. [Y/N] represents whether the cheat is enabled. Whenever you enable/disable it in the emulator, the .CHX cheat file will be modified to save your changes.
2. [CheatCode] must be an NES Game Genie 6- or 8-character cheat code. An NES Game-Genie code looks like this: **GXOUSUSE**.
3. [Name] is a short name that represents this cheat. Since this will appear in the emulator, keep it short (< 30 characters). 

The .CHX must have the same name as your ROM. This is an example of a .CHX file:

Filename: 8 Eyes.CHX
```
Y,GXOUSUSE,Most attacks won't damage Orin
Y,GXNGNOSE,Most attacks won't damage Cutrus
```
